<h1>Calculator</h1>
<h2>🧩 Project Overview</h1>
<p>
  The calculator performs fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface comprises buttons for digits (0–9), operations (+, –, ×, ÷), a decimal point, a clear function, and an equals sign. A display area shows the current input and results.
</p>
<h2>🛠️ Development Steps</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: dashed;"> 
  <li>Project Setup: Initialized a new Android project in Android Studio, selecting Java as the programming language.</li>
  <li>UI Design: Utilized ConstraintLayout in activity_main.xml to arrange buttons and the display. Each button was assigned an onClick attribute to handle user interactions.</li>
  <li>Logic Implementation: In MainActivity.java, defined methods to handle button clicks, manage input, and perform calculations. Variables were used to store operands and the selected operation.</li>
  <li>Functionality: Implemented logic to handle multiple-digit inputs, decimal numbers, and chained operations. The app updates the display in real-time as users input numbers and select operations.</li>
  <li>Testing: Ran the app on an emulator and physical devices to ensure accurate calculations and responsive UI</li>
</ul>
<h2>📱 Final Result</h2>
<p>
  The completed calculator app features a clean interface and handles basic arithmetic operations efficiently. It's a solid foundation for further enhancements, such as implementing advanced mathematical functions or improving the UI design.
